### Three different .m files:
#### 1. Main_filter1, Main_filter2, Main_filter3:

One could excute them directly to investigate all the examples in this paper;

#### 2. Objfunc1, Objfunc2, Objfunc3:

The objective functions for each filter;

#### 3. PlotResponse_filter1, PlotResponse_filter2, PlotResponse_filter3:

Filter response from the synthesized coupling matrix;

#### 4. iFPA

The improved flower pollination algorithm;

More detailed toturials will be added later.
